Use  capacitors  with low-voltage  coefficient  dielectrics.  Aluminum  electrolytic,
tantalum,  or  film  dielectric  capacitors  are  good  choices
for  AC-coupling  capacitors.
 Capacitors  with  high-voltage
coefficients, such as ceramics (non-C0G dielectrics), can
result in increased distortion at low frequencies

THE DEVICE HAS BEEN CONFIGURED WITH AN ATTACK TIME OF 1.1ms, 40dB GAIN, AND AN ATTACK-AND-RELEASE RATIO OF 1:500

A value of 2.2k? is usually sufficient
for a microphone of typical sensitivity. Consult the micro-
phone data sheet for the recommended bias resistor.



For the STM32F030F4P6 Chip I have done following connections
VDD & VDDA to 3.3V
VSS to GND
BOOT open
NRST Connected to ground through capacitor.
and
Connection with Discovery
SWDIO, SDCLK and GND connected from chip.

I would:
Connect NRST to my debug interface
Have a pull-up on NRST
Have a pull-down on BOOT0

Pin 1 Ц VCC:
    This is the traget board Vcc. It is used by the STLINK/V2
Pin 7 Ц TMS/SWDIO:
    The SWD Data signal
Pin 8 Ц GND:
    Be sure there is a common ground
Pin 9 Ц TCK/SWCLK
    The SWD Clock Signal
Pin 15 Ц nSRST/RESET
    System reset Ц probably optional
