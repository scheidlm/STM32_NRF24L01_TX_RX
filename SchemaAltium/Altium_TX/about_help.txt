The simple answer: SWD doesn't need to be connected during boot so boot pin
configuration doesn't matter for that (unless you want to prevent execution
of some "hazardous" SW). If you're intending to write your SW to main flash
 I would just suggest leaving BOOT0 down to save the trouble.

If the case would have been that you want to flash the chip using serial
 (UART1), you'd need to invoke the bootloader (BOOT0=1 BOOT1=0) for that.

Use  capacitors  with low-voltage  coefficient  dielectrics.  Aluminum  electrolytic,
tantalum,  or  film  dielectric  capacitors  are  good  choices
for  AC-coupling  capacitors.
 Capacitors  with  high-voltage
coefficients, such as ceramics (non-C0G dielectrics), can
result in increased distortion at low frequencies

THE DEVICE HAS BEEN CONFIGURED WITH AN ATTACK TIME OF 1.1ms, 40dB GAIN, AND AN ATTACK-AND-RELEASE RATIO OF 1:500

A value of 2.2k? is usually sufficient
for a microphone of typical sensitivity. Consult the micro-
phone data sheet for the recommended bias resistor.
